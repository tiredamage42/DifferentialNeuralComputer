A Differential Neural Computer (DNC) implementation.
Currently, it just learns to repeat back a series of patterns.

Learn more about DNC's [here](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/differentiable-neural-computers).

This DNC implementation and visualizations are based on [this implementation by Mostafa-Samir](https://github.com/Mostafa-Samir/DNC-tensorflow).
